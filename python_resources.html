        <h3>Where to learn Python</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="http://e2eml.school">The courses I offer</a>
          assume you are already comfortable with the basics of Python.
          I don't have any Python-specific tutorials, but there are
          a lot out there already. Based on my
          <a href="https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1039805324423823361">informal polling of data scientists</a>,
          here are some great places to pick up the fundamentals. 
        </p>

        <h4>Getting ready</h4>
        <p>
          If this is your first time learning a computer language, there
          are some foundation pieces, like using the command line,
          that will help you get started.
          <a href="https://e2eml.school/111">e2eML Course 111</a>
          covers these for working on a Mac. (A future course
          will cover the PC.)
        </p>
    
        <h4>Recommended</h4>
        <p>
          I took a look at this material and presentation and resonated with it.
          Also, it was described to me by a student as an experience that "totally changed my life."

            <strong>Dr. Chuck</strong>'s (Prof. Charles Severance)
            <a href="https://www.py4e.com/">Python for Everybody</a> is free.
            There is an accomanying book with the same title.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Coursera</strong> offers
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python
            ">a more official version</a>.
            It includes the videos from the free course,
            but with the addition of extra readings, quizzes, and a certificate.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Also recommended</h4>
        <p>
          There were lots of other courses and programs that come highly recommended by former students.
          Courses that received multiple recommendations are nearer the top, but
          I haven't looked closely at these, so other than that they are in no particular order.
