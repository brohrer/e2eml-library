        <h3>A quick review</h3>
        <p>
          There are many manifestations of mental effort:
          paying attention to a speaker, noticing the patterns on the
          wings of a particular butterfly, planning a route to a dinner date,
          finding the words to tell someone you're breaking up with them,
          puzzling out how to install a bathroom light fixture into a
          space that is half an inch too small. In its different forms,
          mental effort is called called attention,
          deliberation, planning, observation, comprehension.
          I won't try to present a unified theory of the mechanisms
          behind these. For now, I’ll simply group them under the label
          of “focus”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focus requires effort. During focus, a brain consumes oxygen,
          burns calories, and generates chemoelectric activity. 
          We have a limited amount of focus energy. Extended periods of
          focus result in fatigue.  We can increase this capacity over
          time through practice, but it is always limited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Focus is active. It is listening rather than merely hearing.
          Watching rather than seeing.  Deliberating rather than reacting.
          Passive mental activity I'll call "instinct".
          Focus and instinct are mutually exclusive. We can be in one
          mode or the other, but not both at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reading list above is all about focus and instinct:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rapt</strong>: Focus is powerful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flow</strong>: Instinct is powerful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thinking fast and slow</strong>: Both focus and instinct are powerful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subliminal</strong>: Instinct is powerful but can also trick you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deep Work</strong>: Direct your focus to your work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make time</strong>: How to direct your focus to your work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Essentialism</strong>:  Direct your focus to what matters most.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Peace is every step</strong>: How to direct your focus to the world around you.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you only read one book on this list,
          read <strong>Make Time</strong>. It is profound but not preachy.
          Every book on this list had great stories and great suggestions, but this one
          had the most immediately useful collection, most accessibly presented. (

            Thanks Caitlin Hudon for the recommendation!</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
          If you read just one other, read <strong>Peace is Every Step</strong>.
          It's far more practical than it sounds.
          This was my first exposure to this concept of focus,
          which it calls Mindfulness. I've adopted a
          handful of everyday mindfulness practices from it that have
          changed me in ways too deep to plumb.
