        <h3>Where to learn Calculus</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes
          <a href="https://e2eml.school">the courses I offer</a>
          are a bit easier to follow if you are already comfortable with the basics of calculus.
          I don't have any calculus-specific tutorials, but there are
          a lot out there already. Based on my
          <a href="https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1054298773541670912">informal polling of data scientists</a>,
          here are some great places to pick up the fundamentals.
