          Sometimes, when we train a model on our data the coefficients
          don’t look like we think they should. They might be too big 
          or not sparse enough. When this happens, we can add a fudge
          factor to nudge the parameters in a direction that is
          more pleasing. This sounds horribly crude, so mathematicians
          have taken to calling it regularization.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are good reasons for using regularization,
          in addition to aesthetics. The need usually crops up when
          we are using a model that has too many parameters,
          too many degrees of freedom, for our data to robustly identify.
          The way this plays out is that the model ends up fitting not just
          the signal in our data, but the noise as well. The model is
          so powerful, so flexible, so expressive, that it captures not
          just the underlying phenomenon, but also the quirks of how it
          was measured and other unintended sources of interference.
          This is bad if we want to use our model to make predictions
          on previously unseen data. While the underlying patterns will
          be the same, the sources of unmodeled variation and measurement
          noise will be different each time. As a result, models predictions
          will be inaccurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other thing that can happen is that a modeling problem
          may be ill-posed, that is, there may be many solutions,
          many combinations of parameter values, that all give an equally
          good fit. The problem isn’t well-defined enough to have a 
          single best solution. Adding a regularization term is a way to
          give it just enough extra structure that it can find a
          single best option.
        </p>
        <p>
           There are two types of regularization that occur most often
           in machine learning models. We can illustrate them by taking
           a trip to the park.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A Problem in Need of Regularization
        </h3>
        <p>
          Imagine you’re at the park with a dog and two children.
          The dog immediately climbs into a snug cubby under the seat
          of a seesaw and curls up. You push on the other side,
          rocking your pup until she falls asleep. You don’t mind staying
          there for the duration of her nap, but you left your phone in
          the car and would like to listen to a podcast while your doggo
          sleeps and your children play. But if you drop the seesaw
          to go get your phone, your pup will wake up. You are in a pickle.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          To get out of it, you enlist the help of the children.
          You ask them to come climb on the seesaw and sit for a moment
          so that you can run to the car. The smaller child climbs on
          first and get situated in the seat near the end where you are
          holding it. Then the larger of the two climbs on closer to the
          middle, balancing everything out. 
          At that point, the problem is solved.
          The seesaw is balanced and you can step away.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a moment's reflection you get concerned.
          The small child is not at all good at sitting still.
          She is right at the end of the seesaw, and a wiggle in the wrong
          direction will send her toppling off the back onto her head.
          Even though the current arrangement solves the problem you tackled,
          closer inspection of the solution shows that it’s not quite
          what you hoped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/regularization/children.png" 
            alt="A seesaw with a dog sleeping on one end and two children sitting on it to balance it out."
            style="width: 600px;" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In this particular problem, there are two parameters:
          the position of each child. Although having the small child at
          the far end of the seesaw solves the original problem,
          the parameter values you ended up with are troubling.
          Not to worry. You can adjust the problem and nudge the parameter
          values in a direction that you like. There are a lot of
          combinations of positions of the two children that would
          stabilize the seesaw. If the small scoots toward the
          fulcrum, and the bigger child scoots away from it a bit,
          the seesaw will remain balanced.
          This is an example of an ill-posed problem.
          It has many solutions that are equally good. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          L2 Regularization
        </h3>
        <p>
          You have the kids jump off and start over.
          As a regularizer, you grab a conveniently parabolic shaped piece
          of playground equipment nearby with one hand,
          and lay it on top of the seesaw while continuing to hold
          the seesaw in place with the other. Now, the shape of this
          will naturally drive both children toward the middle of the
          seesaw, away from the extreme edge. However, in the
          neighborhood of the fulcrum it’s pretty flat and it doesn’t
          influence their position much.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/regularization/l2_regularization.png" 
            alt="A seesaw with a dog sleeping on one end and two children sitting on itto balance it out. A curved object on top pushes them away from the edge and toward the center."
            style="width: 600px;" />
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in place, the two
          children get back on in a new configuration, both comfortably
          far away from the end of the seesaw, but still balancing out
          the weight of the sleeping dog.
        </p>

        <h3>
          L1 Regularization
        </h3>
        <p>
          You turn to run for your phone, but your instincts niggle again.
          Even in the middle of the seesaw, trusting the smaller child to stay
          put for 30 seconds is wishful thinking. What would be ideal
          would be a solution that only involved the larger child.
          To find this, you make use of yet another set of conveniently
          shaped playground equipment and add gently sloped ramps
          to both sides of the seesaw. The children jump on again,
          finding a balance point. Then as the smaller child wiggles, she
          naturally makes her way down the slope, eventually reaching
          the bottom. The larger child continues to shift away from the
          fulcrum to accommodate. By the time the small child reaches
          the middle, her weight isn’t helping to balance the
          seesaw at all, so she can safely jump off and pursue other
          interests. Now you have a solution relying only on the
          larger child, and you are comfortable grabbing your phone amd
          settling into that podcast for the duration of your puppy's nap.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The two differently shaped wedges represent two different
          strategies for regularization.  What they have in common is that
          they add an extra element of challenge to the problem. Not only
          do the children need to find positions that keep the pup aloft,
          but they need to do it in a way that minimizes their discomfort
          sitting on a sloped surface. 
        </p>
        <p>
           In this problem, maintaining balance is a constraint, but
           there are lots of combinations of big and little child positions
           that will satisfy the constraint. It is ill-posed. To change this,
           we can add an optimization problem on top of it. We can seek
           a combination of positions that’s more desirable. One very common
           regularization criterion is to minimize the sum of the squares
           of all the parameters. This tends to result in parameters that
           are not too big.
        </p>
        <h3>
          When to use what
        </h3>
        <p>
           The square of our position parameters looks like the parabola
           that we sat on top of the seesaw the first time through.
           It shows how it may be uncomfortable to sit toward the ends
           where it is steep, and it will cause a child to migrate
           toward the middle, both to get comfortable and to comply
           with gravity. The formal terminology for the sum of the squares
           of the parameters is the
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">
           Euclidean norm or L2 norm</a>.
           Using the L2 norm as a regularization term is so common,
           it has its own name:
           <strong>Ridge regression</strong> or
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization">
           <strong>Tikhonov regularization</strong></a>.
           The name "ridge" comes from the
           way that, if you plot all the possible solutions to some problems
           in 3D, there is a diagonal line of solutions that are all equally
           good that looks like a mountain ridge.
           It's also known as <strong>weight decay</strong>,
           since in the absence of any other
           gradient-descending it results in a weight exponentially
           decaying toward zero, that is, it's rate of decay toward
           zero is proportional
           to it's distance from zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some models, overfitting looks like lots of large parameter
          values. Keeping them all smallish and similarly-sized is an
          acceptable way to help the model fit the signal but not the noise 
        </p>
        <p>
           Another regularization term we can use is the sum of the
           absolute value of the parameter values. The official name for
           this is the
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Absolute-value_norm">
           Absolute-value norm or L1 norm</a>.
           L1 regularization is also very common and has its own name,
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">
           <strong>LASSO</strong></a>, a tortured acronym for "least absolute shrinkage and
           selection operator".
           Because it has a constant slope, it provides the same pressure
           to all parameters everywhere, driving them to zero. The result
           of this is that non-essential parameters tend to migrate toward
           zero and stay there. The resulting model is then sparse,
           the mathematical lingo for having lots of zeros.
           This is particularly useful in the case where your model is
           overly expressive and has more degrees of freedom then you need
           to represent the patterns in your data. Sparse parameters are
           also nice because the resulting models can be communicated more
           succinctly and calculated more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
           When postulating relationships between real world phenomena,
           L1 regularization also favors simpler explanations and
           solutions involving fewer causes. In the case
           of the seesaw, it freed up one child from participating at all. 
        </p>
        <p>
           There’s no reason not to use both L1 and L2 regularization
           at the same time. This combination is also common enough to
           have its own name:
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_net_regularization">
           <strong>Elastic Net</strong></a>.
           It both provides a soft boundary keeping for parameters from
           getting too large, and nudges them toward zero where they can
           afford to go there without hurting the model's performance
           too badly.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Heads-up
        </h3>
        <p>
          A couple of notes when applying regularization: These methods
          assume that all parameter values have about the same influence.
          The L1 and L2 norms treat all parameters as if they were about
          the same scale. This is approximately true in linear regression an
          logistics regression if you normalize all of your variables
          beforehand, say, to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of
          one. It’s also mostly true for deep neural networks
          within a single layer. However, it’s not true for models where
          parameters have very different influences, like polynomials,
          or almost any domain specific model.  Use with caution.
          If you don’t, regularization will end up robbing you of what
          could have been a great solution. It will end up degrading
          your model dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, keep in mind that there is nothing magical about L1 or L2
          regularization. They are convenient.
          They are glorified fudge factors. Feel free to implement any
          other regularization terms or tools that you deem appropriate.
          When we’ve started adding regularization, we’ve left the realm of
          principled modeling, and moved solidly into the
          practice of hand crafting a model that suits our needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other types of regularization in use. Feel free to
          check out
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29">
          the Regularization wiki page</a>
          for some examples. You can even do things as simple as
          instituting hard limits for parameters or introduce discrete
          logic for setting  parameters to a fixed value under certain
          conditions. If you can justify it to whoever is going to be
          using your model, then that’s all you need.
