          Signal Processing Techniques</a></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          Sometimes we're not so interested in the thing our data measures,
          as we are in how it changes over time. Sea level is interesting,
          but how fast it is changing over hours and years is even more so.
          Population of a town is important, but how fast it is going
          up or down is a critical economic indicator. Customer purchases
          are informative in their own right, but whether customers are
          making those purchases less often is a strong signal for
          predicting whether they'll leave you.
        </p>        
        <p>
          You can also do this with data measured across different positions.
          Elevation data is useful, but how elevation changes as you walk
          tells you how steep the terrain is and is a very important
          factor to keep in mind as you plan your hike.
        </p>
        <p>
          To calculate rate of change, you'll need a series of measurements
          made at regularly spaced intervals of time or distance.
          (There are methods for dealing with irregular intervals, but
          that will be the topic of another post.) For our example,
          we'll measure the temperature, <em>x</em>, at different
          times, <em>t</em>, to find the temperature change per hour,
          <em>v</em>. We'll make those measurements at intervals
          of 1 hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temperature data has lots of uses, but we are trying to choose
          what to wear outside today, so we're interested
          in answering the question of whether it's getting warmer or
          cooler right now. What's the rate of change of temperature
          at this moment?

          style="width: 600px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          The current time is <em>t_0</em>. We would like to know
          if the temperature is going up or down and how fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few different ways to get at this. We can't measure
          it directly. The notion of rate of change comes from calculus
          and derivatives,
          and the only way you calculate it directly is to have measurements
          infinitessimally close together. Our measurements are an hour apart,
          so we're just going to have to do the best we can with that.
          We'll look at three methods: forward difference, backward difference,
          and center difference.
        </p>

        <h3>Forward difference</h3>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img title="Forward difference method illustrated"
          src="images/rate_of_change/forward_difference.png"
          alt="Forward difference method illustrated"
          style="width: 600px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          All three of these methods can be understood as drawing a line
          through two points and finding the slope of that line. How they
          differ is in which two points they use. Forward difference uses
          the current point, at <em>t_0</em>, and the next, at <em>t_1</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The slope of our line is the change in <em>x</em>
          over the change in <em>t</em> for
          any pair of points. For the two points we've chosen, this gives
          us the equation for <em>v(t_0)</em> in the figure above. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that for the very last temperature measurement we make, we
          won't be able to estimate a rate of change with the forward
          difference. There is no next point to use. The number of rate of
          change estimates we get will be one less than the number of
          measurements we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Python implementation of this takes advantage of Numpy's
          <code>diff()</code>. It subtracts every element in an array from
          the one that follows. For a sampling interval <code>dt</code>,
          the forward difference of the array <code>measurements</code> is
          <code>np.diff(measurements) / dt</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Backward difference</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img title="Backward difference method illustrated"
          src="images/rate_of_change/backward_difference.png"
          alt="Backward difference method illustrated"
          style="width: 600px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          In backward difference, the line that we are finding the slope of
          is between the current measurement and the previous measurement.
          It estimates rate of change by looking back.
          The change in value and the change in time between the current
          and the previous measurement give the slope of the line
          that connects them as shown in the figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look carefully, you'll notice that the backward difference
          is calculated the same way as the forward difference,
          but the interpretation is different. The resulting time series
          in both cases is the same, but shifted by one time step.
          Where the forward difference can’t calculate a rate
          for the last element In the sequence, the backward difference
          can’t calculate a rate for the first element. There is nothing
          to look back to.
        </p>

        <h3>Center difference</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img title="Center difference method illustrated"
          src="images/rate_of_change/center_difference.png"
          alt="Center difference method illustrated"
          style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          In the center difference, the two points that are connected
          are the point preceding and the point following the time point
          of interest. To get the slope, we take the difference between
          these two values and we double the time step to account for
          the fact that we skipped a measurement. It is a quirk of the
          center difference that the current measurement isn’t part of
          the rate of change calculation at all. Also, note that because
          the center difference looks both forward and back by one time step,
          it will not be able to create an estimate for either the first or
          last elements of a series.
        </p>
        <p>
          To calculate the center difference in Python on an array of values,
          we will have to do some slicing to pull out an array of
          the pre-measurements and post-measurements for each point
          of interest.
          <code>measurements[: -2]</code> gathers all but the last
          two elements measurements, and
          <code>measurements[2:]</code> gathers all but the first two elements.
          Now we can subtract one from the other to find the pairwise
          difference between each before and after point, and divide
          by two times the time interval <code>dt</code>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>(measurements[2:] - measurements[:-2]) / (2 * dt)</code>
        </p>

        <h3>When to use which</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img title="Difference method comparison"
          src="images/rate_of_change/difference_comparison.png"
          alt="Difference method_comparison"
          style="width: 600px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that these three methods generate very different results.
          According to the backward difference, temperature is decreasing
          rapidly. According to the forward difference, temperature is
          increasing rapidly. And according to the center difference,
          temperature is increasing at a modest pace. Which method you choose
          matters, especially when the phenomenon you're measuring is
          changing on the timescale of your measurement period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The center difference has a lot to recommend it. It's my
          first choice whenever I can use it. Because it is centered around
          the time of interest, it’s not biased in the direction of future
          or past events. And because it incorporates measurements over
          a longer time period, it’s more accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, center difference isn’t an option. If you are at
          the beginning or the end of your time series, then you will be
          stuck With forward or backward difference. A common situation is
          when you want to estimate the rate of change of something
          going on right now. In that case, we don’t have any future
          measurements because they haven’t happened yet. When you’re in
          that situation, backward difference is a fine way to go.
