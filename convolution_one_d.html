          Neural networks can now tell
          with reasonable accuracy whether a photo contains a dog. Not only
          that, but it can tell you what breed of dog it is more accurately
          than most humans. The mathematical magic that makes this possible
          is
          <a href="
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution
          ">convolution</a>. It
          <a href="
            https://e2eml.school/how_convolutional_neural_networks_work.html
          ">endows the neural network</a> with the ability 
          to recognize
          particular patterns within the pixels so that it can
          distinguish a dalmatian from a dachshund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Convolution is a good way to identify patterns in data that is
          directly tied to space or time.
          Adjacent pixels in an image are adjacent for a reason.
          In the physical world, they collect light from neighboring locations.
          Time series data has a similar structure.
          Neighboring data points were produced close together in time
          and are much more likely to be related then points far apart.
          This inherent structure is what convolution exploits.
          It finds local patterns that reoccur in the data.
          It would not be effective, for instance, if we first
          scrambled the pixels in an image.
          That would hide the patterns, the spatial relationships,
          that convolution tries to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The math behind convolution is an artful combination of
          multiplication and addition. 
          We can best get a feel for convolution by looking at a
          one dimensional signal. In this animation, we see
          a shorter sequence, the kernel, being convolved with a
          longer sequence, the signal. The math behind convolution
          doesn’t actually care which of these is longer, but it is
          convenient for us to assign this convention as we develop
          them for neural networks.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Convolution showing kernel being reproduced by several delta functions"
            src="images/conv1d/bb_copy.gif"
            alt="Convolution showing kernel being reproduced by several delta functions"
            style="height: 300px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          The recipe for convolution is surprisingly short:
          <ol>
            <li>Flip the kernel left to right</li>
            <li>Step the kernel along the signal one data point at a time</li>
            <li>At each position, calculate the dot product of the two</li>
              <ul>
                <li>3.1 Multiply each pair of aligned values together</li>
                <li>3.2 Add up those products</li>
              </ul>
            <li>The resulting sequence of dot products is the convolution
              of the kernel with the signal</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          The formal definition of convolution extends from minus infinity
          to plus infinity. You can imagine both the signal and the kernel
          being padded with zeros out forever in both directions.
          The only non-zero values come when there is any overlap between
          the non-zero parts of the signal and the kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, you can choose to keep every part of the convolution
          that is non-zero, or you can limit your results to just those
          convolution values where the kernel completely overlaps the signal.
          You can also choose a compromise, which is to trim the convolution
          result to be the same length as the signal.
          For simplicity, we'll use this last option to start with.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can rewrite this visualization as a sequence of equations.
          We will start by specifying that our signal, <em>x</em>
          is of length </em>m</em>,
          our kernel, <em>w</em>, is of length <em>n</em>
          and both are made up of
          real values. The result, <em>y</em> will be the same size as
          <em>x</em>.
        <p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Signal and kernel definitions"
            src="images/conv1d/defs_1_eq.png"
            alt="Signal and kernel definitions"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        </p>
          To simplify the notation for ourselves later, we will
          add the additional constraint that <em>n</em> is odd, and that the
          length of our kernel can also be expressed as <em>2p+1</em>.
          <em>p</em> in this case is a little less
          than half the length of the kernel.
          For a kernel with <em>n=5</em>,<em>p</em> would be 2. 
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">

            alt="Signal and kernel definitions"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, by walking through the recipe for convolution for a few
          steps, we can write out longhand the equations for each
          value of <em>y</em>, using the signal <em>x</em> and the kernel
          <em>w</em>.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">

            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          Thankfully we can use the summation shorthand to represent this
          more concisely. In this formulation, any time we refer to a
          signal value outside the non-zero range of [0, <em>m</em>-1],
          we substitute in a zero. 
        </p>

            alt="Convolution calculations, with summations"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          And we can shorten it further by indexing on the signal position.
        </p>

        <h4 id="xcorr">Convolution vs. cross-correlation</h4>
        <p>
          There is understandable confusion between
          <a href="
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution
          ">convolution</a> and
          <a href="
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation
          ">cross-correlation</a>. For discrete arrays of values,
          like we are showing
          here and like what would be used in any neural network,
          they are identical except that in cross-correlation the
          kernel is not flipped left-to-right before calculating the sliding
          dot product.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The distinction gets blurrier if you simply store and
          handle the
          convolution kernel in its pre-flipped state. Then it looks
          <em>exactly</em> like cross-correlation. Avoiding the kernel
          flip every time through the network may save some
          computation time. My understanding is that this is what
          PyTorch and TensorFlow do under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a side note, you can cross-correlate a signal
          with itself, and the result is called an autocorrelation.
          (
          <a href="
            https://youtu.be/ZjaBn93YPWo
          ">An alternative interpretation of autocorrelation</a> is
          that is shows how well
          a signal correlates with itself when shifted by a certain number
          of time steps.)
        </p>

        <h3>Differentiation</h3>
        
        <p>
          Since we are planning to use convolution in our network,
          we are only halfway done. Neural networks rely on backpropagation
          to learn their parameters, and backpropagation needs every step
          of the computation to be differentiable. We can stack any
          type of layer we want in a neural network, as long as we can
          take its derivative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process for setting up a layer for backpropagation is similar
          no matter what that layer does. The output gradient
          (the partial derivative of the loss function with respect
          to each of the layer's outputs) is the starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make backpropagation work, we have to calculate two groups
          of derivatives, the input gradient 
          (the partial derivative of each of the layer's inputs
          with respect to the loss function), and the parameter gradient
          (the partial derivative
          of each or of the layer's adjustable parameters with respect
          to the loss function).
        </p>
        <p>
          The input gradient is passed back to the previous layer
          in the network, which continues the process on up the line.
          The parameter gradient is used with an optimizer, like stochastic
          gradient descent, to adjust parameter values in an effort
          to get value of the loss function as low as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we will step through the process of calculating
          the input gradient and the parameter gradient
          for one dimensional convolution. Keep in mind that you can follow
          a similar process for any differential computation that you
          would like to build into a neural network layer.
        </p>

        <h4>Input gradient</h4>
        <p>
          By the chain rule,
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Calculation of the input gradient"
            src="images/conv1d/input_grad_1_eq.png"
            alt="Calulation of the input gradient"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the input gradient we'll have to find the derivative of
          every input with respect to every output. To get at that, we
          can go back to one of our outputs at position <em>j</em>, not too
          close to either end of the array and write out the convolution
          equation for it.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="More calculation of the input gradient"
            src="images/conv1d/input_grad_2_eq.png"
            alt="More calulation of the input gradient"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          In this form, we can take the derivative of each input with
          respect to the outputs it contributes to.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Yet more calculation of the input gradient"
            src="images/conv1d/input_grad_3_eq.png"
            alt="Yet more calulation of the input gradient"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          With some rearranging, we can group the terms by input.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Even more calculation of the input gradient"
            src="images/conv1d/input_grad_4_eq.png"
            alt="Even more calulation of the input gradient"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point a neat pattern appears. We can use this to re-write
          the full expression for the input gradient from above.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Simplified calculation of the input gradient"
            src="images/conv1d/input_grad_5_eq.png"
            alt="Simplified calulation of the input gradient"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          If we adopt the notation of a left-facing arrow over an array to
          indicate that it has been reversed, left-to-right, pivoting
          about zero, then we can
          rewrite the input gradient as another convoltion with the reversed
          kernel. Note that <em>i</em> here varies between 0 and <em>m</em>-1,
          and that any values outside the range of the output
          gradient are assumed to be zero.
        </p>

          <img title="Concise calculation of the input gradient"

            alt="Concise calulation of the input gradient"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <h4>Parameter gradient</h4>
        <p>
          As with inputs, the goal is to find the partial derivative
          of the loss function with respect to each of the parameters, that is,
          each of the element values within the kernel.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">

            alt="Calulation of the parameter gradient"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          We can make use of the expanded formulas for the outputs above
          to calculate the components of the parameter gradients too.
          Each of these expressions can be differentiated with respect
          to the parameters:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Expanded calculation of the parameter gradient"

            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that we have some practice, we can pull out a similar pattern
          and simplify the expressions.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Calculation of the parameter gradient, simplified"

            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          In this form, it is amenable to translating to computer code.
          However, for you who enjoy the mathematical pleasures of
          symmetry,
          the final result can be massaged into convolution if we again
          flip the array of input values left-to-right, pivoting around zero. 
          Note that <em>k</em> here varies between <em>-p</em>,and <em>p</em>,
          and that any values outside the range of the output
          gradient are assumed to be zero.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3 id="padding">Handling the beginning and the end</h3>
        <p>
          In order to make our output array <em>y</em> the same size as our
          input array <em>x</em>, we added a few extra zeros to each end of
          our input array. This practice is called padding.
          It’s pretty helpful when you need an array that’s a different
          size than the one you have.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Convolution signal padded with zeroes"
            src="images/conv1d/pad_zeros.png"
            alt="Convolution signal padded with zeroes"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          The downside of padding an array with zeros is that we are actually
          fabricating data, and when we do this it’s possible to corrupt our
          signal. For instance, if our one dimensional data was
          a sequence of stock prices, adding zeros at the beginning
          and the end might make investors nervous.
          They don’t reflect reality. The desire is to extend the data
          with neutral points. In this case, zeros would be
          anything but neutral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another option for padding that can be quite benign is
          padding wtih non-zero constant values. We can choose some constant,
          such as the median of the array, or the average of the first
          six data points, or even the value of the first point, and pad
          the array with that.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Convolution signal padded with constant values"
            src="images/conv1d/pad_const.png"
            alt="Convolution signal padded with constant values"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          Another option is mirror padding. In this case, we take whatever
          the length of the additional pad needs to be, pull that many values
          off the beginning (or the end), flip them around left-to-right,
          and attach them as the pad. This results in a short tail that is
          the mirror image of the original beginning (and end) of the data.
          For some data sets this creates a nice neutral set of data points
          that doesn’t change the meaning of the data. However, consider
          the case for you have daily time series data and a very
          big difference between weekday values and weekend values.
          In this case, taking a mirror image of the last few data points
          may get you two weekends in a row, or no weekends at all for
          10 days. This would not result in a neutral extension of the data.
        </p>

            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet another trick is circular padding. In this case, the last
          few elements are taken off the end of the array and copied over
          and tacked onto the beginning. Similarly, a copy of the first
          few elements is tacked onto the end. This makes the array appear
          as if it was part of a circular, repeating pattern. This can make
          good sense for time series data that is chopped into
          an whole number of weeks, or of years, or of whatever
          time interval is fundamental to the process being measured.

        <p>
          If you look carefully, all these different padding strategies
          generate different results. Padding is a fine idea as long
          as you have a good feeling for how to extend the data set
          in a way that doesn't corrupt it or change its meaning
          dramatically.

        <p>
          In a convolutional neural network, 
          there’s nothing that says that our output array needs to be
          the same size as our input array. One very safe way to make sure
          all of our data is valid is to limit our convolutions to the
          positions in which the kernel is completely supported by the input.
          When we do this, our output is shorter than our input by the
          length of our kernel minus one. It also gives us
          peace of mind that every single output point is the result of
          a valid convolution. It frees us up from having to
          invent plausible data.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Convolution signal unpadded"
            src="images/conv1d/no_pad.png"
            alt="Convolution signal unpadded"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          When we limit ourselves to valid convolutions, the math changes
          only superficially. Instead of both the input and output having
          the same length <em>m</em>, our input will have length <em>m_x</em>,
          and our output will have length <em>m_y</em>, equal to
          <em>m_x - n + 1</em>, where <em>n</em>  is the length of the kernel.
          In the equations above where we calculate <em>y</em> all we have
          to do is limit our <em>y</em> indices to the valid positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to think about this is that we still start
          with a <em>y</em> array the same size as our <em>x</em> array,
          but the only values we calculate are the valid,
          fully supported ones. The others
          stay empty and don’t get passed on to the next layer as outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          When calculating gradients, we can do the reverse. We track the
          valid values for <em>dL/dy</em>, and
          if the equation asks for any not-valid value it gets a zero instead.
          This helps it to ignore all of the locations that don’t have an
          output gradient associated with them.
        </p>

        <h4>Python implementation</h4>

        <p>
          Numpy‘s <code>convolve()</code> function handles one dimensional
          convolution seamlessly. You can specify
          <code>mode="full"</code> to keep all the non-zero values,
          <code>mode="valid"</code> to only keep the completely overlapping
          values, or <code>mode="same"</code> to ensure the result is the
          sampe length as the signal.
          What we described here is equivalent to working
          with the <code>mode="same"</code> condition.

        <h3 id="stride">Stride</h3>
        <p>
          Another useful trick in calculating convolutions for neural networks
          is to not calculate them for every pixel, but to skip to every
          second or third value. This skip is called a stride. Calculating
          the convolution at every location corresponds to a stride of one.
          Skipping every second value is a stride of two, and so forth.
          The number of calculations that you have to do for one dimensional
          convolution is one over the stride, so you can see the
          efficiency motivator behind it.
        </p>


        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Convolution with stride 1"

            style="width: 400px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          When we go to implement a stride convolution, we can use
          the same trick of initializing an output array the same size as
          our input array, then step through it and only calculate
          convolutions for the locations that match our stride.
          Then when we’re done, we pull out and condense just the calculated
          convolutions and pass them on as the output.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then when we go to backpropagate the output gradient,
          we can create a full array of zeros that matches the size if the
          input array, and we can populate it with all of the strided
          output gradient values. Then, it will look like a complete,
          dense set of output gradients, but with all of the skipped values
          as zeros. From there, we can treat it as we would any other
          complete set of output gradients, and the zeros in the skipped
          positions will ensure that they get handled appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
        The fastest computations are the ones you never have to do,
        so introducing a stride can speed up a neural network considerably.

        <h3 id="multichannel"> Multiple channels </h3>
        <p>
          One dimensional data often comes in the form of
          several parallel channels or streams.
          Economic data can be collected as many different indices
          (say, the price of a barrel of oil, the gross domestic product,
          and the unemployment rate) collected over the same time period
          at the same intervals. Weather data can be organized as
          hourly temperature
          measurements collected at different locations.
          Electroencephalographic recordings come in a bundle of 128 channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          What defines a multichannel signal
          is that the signals within it share a common axis &mdash;
          in these examples, all measurements were made at the same times.
          The order of events on this organizaing axis matters.
          Rearranging the items in a time sequence scrambles the meaning
          out of it. What makes these different than a true two dimensional
          signal is that the order of the channels themselves doesn't matter.
          You can re-order the list of cities in a set of temperature
          measurements and it doesn't change what the data means.
          If the temperature-by-city data were represented in a table,
          with each row being a city and each column being an hourly
          measurement, then we can see how rearranging the rows
          wouldn't mess up the data set, but rearranging the columns would
          make it much harder to interpret. Another way to say that is
          that the row order doesn't contain any information, but
          the column ordering does.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a multichannel signal, we can treat teach channel independently,
          as its own flavor or color of data, not to be mingled with
          the others. Because of this, we can't expect that the same
          kernel structure will be meaningful across different channels.
          To handle this, we instead create and learn multi-channel kernels
          &mdash; a stack of kernels bound together, one for each channel.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Multi-channel convolution"
            src="images/conv1d/multichannel.gif"
            alt="Multi-channel convolution"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          The math for multi-channel convolution looks almost the same
          as for single channel, except for an additional summation
          over all the channels. For gradient calculations it's even
          more similar. You just have to work with one channel at a time.
          In the equations below, <em>c</em> is the channel index.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img title="Multichannel convolution equations"

            alt="Multichannel convolution equations"
            style="width: 600px;">
        </p>

        <p>
          The result of a multichannel convolution is a single channel
          output. Because the sliding dot product covers all the channels
          at once, they all get summed together and reduced down to a
          single channel. 
          However, a convolutional layer will have several kernels.
          Each kernel acts as a feature detector, so the result
          of the convolution is sometimes called a <em>feature map</em>,
          a map that shows where in the signal the kernel occurred.
          The combined result of a set of kernels is a collection
          of feature maps. For one dimensional data, this is a
          multichannel one dimensional signal.
          (Typically the number of kernels in a layer is a small exponent
          of two, like 16 or 64.
          The exact number is a hyperparameter that can be adjusted
          based on the particular problem you are working on.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we've closed the circle on
          one dimensional convolution layers.
          A convolution layer accepts a multichannel one dimensional signal,
          convolves it with each of its multichannel kernels, and
          stacks the results together into a new multichannel signal
          that it passes on to the next layer. Because its outputs
          look like its inputs, it means we can stack as many of them together
          as we like, just like Lego bricks.
        </p>

        <h3 id="bias">Bias</h3>
        <p>
          The only piece we are missing now is the bias. Each output
          has a learned bias value that is added into the result of
          the convolution. It’s a constant value, <em>b</em>.
          It is similar to the bias node in a dense neural network.
          It provides a constant offset to a given output whenever
          it's advantageous to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the bias stands alone, it doesn’t show up anywhere
          in the input gradient. The derivative of the output with
          respect to a constant bias is always one, making a
          trivial addition to the collection of parameter gradients.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final set of equations looks like this: 
        </p>
