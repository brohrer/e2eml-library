          Working with sound is cool because it's one of very few ways
          that the outside world can touch the inside of a computer.
          When I talk, I shake atoms back and forth, which push and pull
          on a microphone, which pushes and pulls on electrons in a wire,
          which gets converted to a voltage, which gets represented as
          a floating point number for my program to work with. And as
          a bonus it can turn around and do the reverse. It's all the
          hardware connections we need to re-create the Star Trek computer
          voice interface. (The algorithms still need some work.)
        </p>
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>
          To get set up for sound in Python, you'll need the
          <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sounddevice/">sounddevice</a>
          package.
          This is a cross platform tool
          (it works on Mac, Windows, and Linux) that
          talks to your machine's speakers and microphone.
          It converts sound to and from
          NumPy arrays, which is perfect if you want to use it for
          signal processing and machine learning applications, which we do.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the command line run
        </p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install sounddevice</pre></code>
        <p>
          Heads up: if you're working on Linux, you may get
          <a href="https://techoverflow.net/2019/08/05/how-to-fix-pyaudio-fatal-error-portaudio-h-no-such-file-or-directory/">
            this "missing portaudio.h" error</a> during the pip installs.
          If that happens, you'll have to manually install PortAudio,
          another library that sounddevice relies on. On my Ubuntu machine
          that is done with
        </p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install portaudio19-dev</code></pre>

        <h3>Recording sound</h3>
        <p>
          To start recording, we have to specify the number of channels
          (1 for mono, 2 for stereo) and the number of samples.
          If our device has a sampling rate of 44,100 samples per
          second and we want to record for 2 seconds, that would
          give total of n_samples = 44,100 x 2 = 88,200. (44,100
          or 48,000 samples per second are what you're most likely
          to see on your computer.)
        </p>
<pre><code>import sounddevice as sd  
recorded_array = sd.rec(n_samples, channels=2, blocking=True)</code></pre>
        <p>
          The <code>blocking=True</code> option forces the rest of your code to
          wait until the recording is complete before it carries on.
          This records the audio as a NumPy array, which sets it up for
          whatever signal processing or machine learning shenanigans
          you can dream up.
        </p>

        <h3>Playing sound</h3>
        <p>
          There's a complementary one liner to
          play back a NumPy array as sound.
        </p>
<pre><code>sd.play(recorded_array, blocking=True)</code></pre>
        <p>
          This level of convenience for turning arrays into sound opens
          up a lot of possibilities for turning data into
          "auralizations" &mdash; audio representations of data.

          Knock yourself out!
