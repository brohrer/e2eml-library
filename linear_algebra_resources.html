        <h3>Linear Algebra for Data Scientists</h3>
        <p>
          If you're a data scientist studying linear algebra, chances are
          you are interested in understanding how machine learning
          algorithms work. Neural networks rely on it heavily,
          but so do linear regression, factor analysis, and
          <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/examples-of-linear-algebra-in-machine-learning/">
            lots of other methods</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The generous professionals of the Internet shared their favorite
          linear algebra resources on
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brohrer_where-to-learn-calculus-activity-6569183583355887616-Fb8x">
            LinkedIn</a> and
          <a href="https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1163423524079452163?s=20">
            Twitter</a>.
          There are a lot of great recommendations here, and I recommend you
          scroll through them if you'd like to go deeper into the topic
          and catch it from multiple angles.
          However, a couple of clear winners emerged.

        <p>
          Two million YouTube subscribers (to a math channel!) can't be wrong.
          Linear algebra concepts lend themselves to illustration,
          and the beautiful graphics in these videos exploit this fully.
          All the scary terms are explained in straightforward words
          and animations. This is a fantastic place to start, partciularly
          if you have a touch of anxiety about the topic.

          My first exposure to linear algebra was not gentle. It consisted
          entirely of theorems, proofs, and intimidating words. It was
          quite some time after that first course before I started
          to build an intuition for the concepts. 3Blue1Brown is the
          preparation I wish I'd had then.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the way, if you find the 3Blue1Brown series helpful,
          do youself a favor and
          <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">support the work</a>.
          Grant relies on viewer contributions to support his work.

        <h3>Gilbert Strang</h3>

        <p>
          Professor Strang's lectures for MIT's undergraduate linear
          algebra course (18.06) are a crowd favorite. He keeps the
          material grounded in computation and application, suiting
          it well for the curious data scientist. Professor Strang's mastery
          is unquestionable, his ability to break down abstract ideas
          into concrete examples is rare, and his passion for
          the subject is like nothing I've ever seen.

        <p>
          This video series is particularly meaningful to me since it
          was recorded in 1999, right when I was taking the course
          from him. I wasn't in this particular section. I definitely
          was <em>not</em> the guy napping in the eighth row. But
          the insights I got during that semester and Professor Strang's
          infectious enthusiasm are still fresh.
