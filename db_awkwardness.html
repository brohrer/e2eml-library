          One of the things that can make databases awkward at first,
          <a href="https://e2eml.school/db_first_db.html">
            especially in Python</a>,
          is the terminology. It’s based on some old school
          concepts and technologies.
          A very long time ago bits were carved into stone tablets with
          magnetic chisels. These tablets were circular in shape and
          stacked on top of each other, resulting in something
          shaped like a can, or a drum.

        <p>
          And this is why databases are always represented as cylinders
          in architecture diagrams, like this:

        <p>
          But this doesn't tell us anything about how to actually
          work with them. For that it's helpful to dig into how
          they organize data.
        </p>

        <h2>Databases are clumsy Spreadsheets</h2>
        <p>
          If it’s helpful, you can think of databases
          as spreadsheets. This trick only works for relational databases,
          but thankfully, they are the most common type by a wide margin.
          Just like a spreadsheet can contain a lot of separate pages
          or sheets, a database can contain many different tables.
          And just as in each spreadsheet page, data in a table is
          arranged into rows and columns. Each individual column is a uniform
          type of thing from top to bottom, like a date or an age or a name.
          Each row is typically some kind of object or entity,
          like a customer or a company, or an observation,
          or an experimental apparatus. Each column captures
          a different attribute of the object in that row.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          Spreadsheet or Database? Who can say?
        </p>

        <p>
          Since they are so similar, you might be tempted to ask
          "Aren’t spreadsheets and databases basically the same thing?"
          If you ask this question on the Internet, you’re guaranteed
          to get some strongly opinionated answers. While they share
          similar patterns for organizing data, there are some
          important differences between them which make them
          fit for very different types of jobs. It mostly boils down
          to scale. If you are one person, manually entering and
          modifying a hundred rows of data with ten columns each,
          a spreadsheet is the perfect tool. You can see everything
          in a glance and change it in an intuitive way. But if you
          have a hundred people, plus a handful of automated processes,
          reading and writing data to tables with a hundred columns
          in a million rows, you absolutely do not want to try doing that
          in a spreadsheet. If you ask nicely, the opinionated
          respondents on the Internet will share horror stories with
          you of organizations that have tried to do exactly this.
        </p>

        <h2>Quirky Database Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          OK, so databases are big. But that only goes partway
          to explaining why they are so clunky.
          To understand the rest we have to talk about brown M&amp;Ms.
          There is an urban legend that the (now classic) rock band
          Van Halen had in their contract a clause that the dressing
          rooms were to be stocked with a bowl full of M&amp;Ms, and that
          all the brown ones had to be removed.
          This inspired all kinds of eye rolling about hair band divas.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img width="512"
            alt="photocopy of the brown M&M clause from the Van Halen contract: (WARNING: ABSOLUTELY NO BROWN ONES)"
            src="https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2014/12/vanhalenrider.jpg">
        </p>

        <p>
          Funny enough the reality was not too far off. Van Halen had,
          for that time, an unusual amount of equipment and effects
          that went into their shows. The success of the show as well as
          the safety of the band and audience depended on the mechanical
          and electrical specifications being met. The contract that
          included all of this was famously large, and there was a
          justifiable fear that venues would not do a detailed reading.
          The brown M&amp;Ms clause is included as a check on this.
          It was a visible detail that helped indicate whether
          the invisible details had all been attended to.
          (This is a super fun read
          <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/">
            on Snopes.com</a>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Databases are a bit like this. It’s true, they could be
          designed with a more intuitive interface, and there are some
          tools that attempt this, but the ungainliness of the
          interface serves at least
          partially as a check that the database user is thinking
          about it the right way.
        </p>
          
        <h2>Connections</h2>
        <p>
          <code>connection = sqlite3.connect("my_first.db")</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          These original databases were pieces of silicon furniture far too
          heavy and expensive to lug around so they sat off in an
          air-conditioned room somewhere. To get at the data you wanted
          to use you had to first connect to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The notion of having to establish a connection is a bit weird
          since our computers now are perpetually connected to everything.
          It’s doubly awkward if you are hosting a database in memory
          on your own local machine. What are you even connecting to?
          But for better or worse, "connection" is database speak for
          "open the channel, spin it up, start talking, ready to go".
          I like to think of it as a big drawbridge that’s lowered to
          connect your machine on one side to a fortified castle, holding
          the precious database on the other. Whether it sits on your
          hard drive, your RAM, your office server down the hall,
          or AWS's us-east-1 in Virginia, connection means that there
          is now a pathway for you to get to the database.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Cursors</h2>
        <p>
          <code>cursor = connection.cursor()</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          Having a bridge in place doesn’t allow you to do anything
          useful all on its own. You are still stuck on one side and the
          data is on the other. And to complicate matters you’re not allowed
          to cross the bridge, and the data is stored vaults in the
          castle's catacombs that can run for miles. To do anything useful,
          you have to employ a cursor. In my imagination, a cursor is a small,
          extremely fast robot, and they are very good at following
          instructions. For instance, you can tell the cursor to cross the
          bridge, roam the the catacombs, and pull all of the data from
          a table for a particular date. The cursor robot will dutifully
          speed across the bridge, race through the catacombs,
          find all the relevant pieces of data, make
          photocopies of them, and stack them in a neat pile on the far
          side of the drawbridge.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point, the cursor has organized what you asked for
          via an <code>execute()</code> command, but the data is still
          sitting on the other side of the moat. Luckily, you can also
          instruct your cursor to <code>fetchone()</code> piece data for you,
          and it will
          race back-and-forth across the bridge at a lightning
          speed bringing you the data element off the top of the stack.
          There’s also a shortcut
          way to ask your cursor robot to get you a certain number of these,
          <code>fetchmany()</code>, or to just grab all of them,
          however many there might be, <code>fetchall()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The notion of a cursor will be familiar
          to you if you’ve ever had to deal with file pointers.
          These keep track explicitly of what location in a file
          you are reading
          from or writing to. Tracking a file pointer does result
          in a more complex mental model, and in higher level languages
          the default toolsets abstract it away 
          so you don’t have to keep track of it in your head.
          But in databases it’s still alive and well.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea of an explicit cursor comes in handy with databases
          where there can be many people writing to or reading from a
          table at any given time. We can think of an army of small robots,
          crawling through the catacombs, carrying out the instructions
          of their users on the other side of the bridge. This lets us
          reason explicitly about what to do when two robots want to
          read the same piece of information at the same time.
          Or even trickier, when two robots both want to change
          the same piece of information at the same time. Or hairier still,
          when one robot has made a copy of a piece of data,
          and then another robot comes behind them and writes a new
          value to it. This topic is known as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control">
            concurrency</a>
          and different database designs handle concurrency
          differently. They all are appropriate for different use
          cases and come with their trade-offs. But the important part
          is that having cursors forces us to think about concurrency a
          little more explicitly.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a></h2>
        <p>
          <code>cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM breakfast")</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          SQL is the language of the cursor robots (pronounced
          "sequel" by
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brohrer_lets-settle-this-once-and-for-all-activity-7111157543258730497-JjpZ">
            two-thirds of LinkedIn</a> and "ess-kew-ell"
          by the other third.) It reads like
          instructions written by Yoda&mdash;backwards and out of order.
          But luckily the order is consistent and if you have a cheat
          sheet you can get it right every time.
          If you are new to SQL
          or want to up your your game there are some fantastic
          <a href="https://e2eml.school/sql_resources">learning resources</a>
          to choose from, and a DuckDuckGo search of "
          <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sql+cheat+sheet&atb=v255-1&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images">
            sql cheat sheet</a>"
          gets you two months of SQL course knowledge printable
          on an A4/letter-sized piece of paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you get comfortable using SQL to talk to the cursor-robots
          you can get them to do astounding things. I myself
          have been using SQL for close to 10 years, but when I see
          a real SQL artisan at work I am in awe. They can
          sweet talk the robots into gathering the exact 83,003 items they need
          out of billions, light them on fire, juggle them in a figure-eight,
          and weave them into a poncho. SQL may be far from natural
          for humans, but it is custom built for finding and manipulating
          items in tables. If you can shoehorn your data manipulation
          into a SQL statement, SQL will usually be able
          to do it a lot faster than you can. Let the cursor-robots
          do your dirty work.

        <p>
          If all this isn't enough to scare you off then,
          congratulations! Your
          relational database relationship has graduated to the
          status of second date. Now go make beautiful
          tables together.
