        <p>
          I built Evolutionary Powell's method to use for
          hyperparameter optimization
          as part of
          <a href="https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/314-neural-network-optimization/">
            Course 314</a>. It is inspired by the original
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_method">
            Powell's method</a>, but has a stochastic element
          inspired by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">
            evolutionary approaches</a>.
          A Python implementation of the algorithm is available in
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/brohrer/ponderosa">
            the Ponderosa optimization package</a> under an
          <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">
            MIT Open Source License</a>.
        </p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Evolutionary Powell's method tries to find the global minimum
          of a loss function (cost function, error function) over a
          discrete space, meaning that each variable can only take on
          a finite number of unique values. It has a few main steps, which
          we'll illustrate by walking through the example in the animation
          above.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Two dimensional sinc function"
            src="images/evopowell/two_d_sinc.png"
            style="height: 200px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          The loss function we'll be working with is a two-dimensional
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_function">
            <em>sinc</em></a> function, which has a single pronounced
          peak and several shoulder peaks and dips surrounding it.
          The code for creating it and running the rest of this example
          can be found in
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/brohrer/ponderosa/blob/master/ponderosa/demo.py">
            this GitLab project</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The optimizer actually tries to find
          the lowest point in the the negative of this function &mdash;
          the global minimum &mdash; but for ease of visualization everything
          is flipped upside down before plotting, so it looks like it's trying
          to find the top of the peak. Both x and y are allowed
          to take on 10 distinct values between 0 and 3. The method can
          be applied to spaces of any number of dimensions, but a
          two-dimensional space gives the richest visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few main steps to Evolutionary Powell's method.
          <ol>
            <li>
              Randomly select a few points and evaluate them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make a list of the hyperparameters in random order.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose a small number of previously-evaluated points
              to be parents. This will be
              a random choice, but weighted by performance so that points
              with the lowest error are more likely to be chosen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
              For the first parent added, start at the top of the list
              of hyperparameters. Look for a small number of unevaluated
              child points along that line &mdash; points that are identical 
              to the parent, differing only in the value of that particular
              hyperparameter. If no children can be found, check the next
              hyperparameter, until they have all been attempted.
              </p>
              <p>
              If no children are found for the first parent candidate
              repeat the process with the next, but
              shift the list of hyperparameters by one so that a different
              hyperparameter is attemped first.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Evaluate all the children found and start again at step 3.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Powell's method</h3>
        <p>
          This is a little like Powell's method where, starting from a single
          point, it finds the minimum along one dimension at a time,
          and the new best guess is moved iteratively to the new location
          of the minimum.
          (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_method">
            There's a bit more to it than that</a>, but those
          are the relevant parts.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Powell's method typically assumes smooth, continuously varying
          functions, and seeks just to find the local minimum, so it
          alone isn't a good fit for hyperparameter optimization
          where we are looking for a global minimum in a discrete space.
          But it at least is nice in that it doesn't require differentiation
          and it manages a large number of dimensions gracefully.
        </p>

        <h3>Evolutionary algorithms</h3>
        <p>
          In high-dimensional discrete spaces, evolutionary algorithms have
          proven themselves useful. They don't have to
          assume anything about the
          smoothness of a function, and they can be used as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anytime_algorithm">
            an anytime algorithm</a>, meaning that you can interrupt the
          algorithm at any time and have a workable best-so-far answer
          to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evolutionary algorithms are especially useful when there are
          far more points in the space than could ever be exhaustively
          explored. They make the assumption that the lowest-error points
          will have at least some traits in common with other
          low-error points. In our case, that assumption is expressed as
          "successful points will have <em>some</em> identical hyperparameter
          values". Choosing the most-successful-so-far points as parents,
          and varying one of their hyperparameter values to create children,
          is a way to exploit this assumption. This is also where
          the similarity to Powell's method comes from. Exploring
          one dimension at a time, starting from a high performing point,
          looks a lot like the iterative one-dimensional optimization that
          Powell's method performs.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          It's worth taking a detailed tour of the method, step-by-step.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Randomly select a few points</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Two random points selected and evaluated"
            src="images/evopowell/f_10007.png"
            style="height: 350px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing we need is to choose a few points to start with.
          We don't want to assume anything about which dimensions are
          important or whether we prefer high or low values. The safest
          way to avoid systematic bias is to randomly choose a few points in
          our space. In this example, we start with two. Subsequent
          playing around with the algorithm suggests that twice the number
          of hyperparameters is a good number of points to start with.
          It sprinkles its guesses throughout the space and gives
          a reasonably rich population of points to start from.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Make a list of hyperparameters</h3>
        <p>
          Just to make sure our results aren't sensitive to the order in which
          we search the hyperparameters, we generate a shuffled list of them.
          Each hyperparameter represents one dimension in our space.
          We don't want to give any one of them preferential treatment.
          Later, we'll also rotate through the list so that we start searching
          along a different dimension each time.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Choose a few parent points</h3>
        <p>
          From all the points we've tried and evaluated so far, we choose
          a few candidate parents. (This number is set to 3 right now.) 
          We expect that high-performing, low-error points are likely
          to make the best parents <strong>but</strong> we don't
          want to make that assumption too rigid. To allow room
          for accidental discovery, we randomly select our parents from
          the population, but we weight better performing points
          more heavily.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also want to avoid the pathological situation where there is
          one point that is very strong compared to all the rest, but
          because there are just so many of the others, it gets
          overwhelmed by their collective weights, and
          it never gets selected as a parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fix this, the weights
          of each point are calculated as the square of its
          normalized position between the highest error and the lowest error,
          resulting in weights that fall on [0, 1]. 0 is the weight of
          the worst-performing point and 1 is the weight of the best.
          Then a random number is drawn from a uniform distribution.
          The point with the next-highest weight on the [0, 1] interval
          is the parent selected. This ensures that parents are selected
          with stratification based on their relative error, rather than
          their relative prevalence.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Choose a few children</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Child points selected for first parent"
            src="images/evopowell/f_10016.png"
            style="height: 350px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first parent selected, start with the hyperparameter
          at the top of the list we created in step 2. Randomly select
          points along that dimension, up to a maximum of a set
          fraction of all the possible values it can take. Right now
          this fraction is set to 30%. If at least one unevaluated child
          is found for that parent, stop evaluating potential parents
          and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time through the child selection process for a new parent,
          rotate the list of hyperparameters
          to the right by one, so that what was the last dimension
          becomes the first, what was the first becomes the second, etc.
          That way each new child selection process starts looking along
          a different dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no unevaluated children are found along that dimension,
          try the next one on the list. If no unevaluated children are found
          for that parent along any dimension, try the next
          parent. If no unevaluated children are found for any of the
          parent candidates, terminate the search. Evolutionary Powell's
          is done looking.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a fairly conservative stopping criteria. Especially for
          a high dimensional space, for a parent to have no unevaluated
          children means that a reasonable fraction of the space
          has been exhasutively explored. It is more likely that on
          optimization runs with many parameters, other constraints will
          cause the researcher to terminate the search before it runs its
          course, such as time or computing expense.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Evaluate each of the children chosen</h3>
        <p>
          If a new lowest error is found, update the best-so-far error
          and the best-so-far combination of hyperparameters. These will
          be available as results if the algorithm is terminated before
          the next better solution is found.
        </p>
          
        <h3>6. Repeat</h3>
          When all the pre-selected
          children are evaluated, return to step 3 and go through the
          child selection process again until no more can be found for the
          chosen parents.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Results after second iteration"
            src="images/evopowell/f_10021.png"
            style="height: 350px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the set of evaluated points after two iterations through
          this algorithmic loop. Already it has found a relatively
          high-performing point.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Results after third iteration"
            src="images/evopowell/f_10032.png"
            style="height: 350px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third iteration, it chooses a high performing point
          (not the highest), and explores the x-axis to find a still
          better one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Results after a few more iterations"
            src="images/evopowell/f_10071.png"
            style="height: 350px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few more iterations, it can be seen that mostly
          the higher-performing points have been chosen as parents,
          and they have generated children along both axes.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Results after a few more iterations"
            src="images/evopowell/f_10123.png"
            style="height: 350px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time 30 points have been evaluated, the global optimum
          has been found. Not too bad, considering there are 100 points
          in the space. We would expect random exploration to find the
          global optimum on average on its 50th point, so this is somewhat
          of an improvement.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
          <img
            alt="Results after a few more iterations"
            src="images/evopowell/f_10211.png"
            style="height: 350px;">
        </p>
        <p>
          After exploring about 2/3 of the space, the algorithm has
          been unable to find any unevaluated children for the three
          parent candidates it selected. It terminates.
        </p>

        <h3>The trade-off between generality and performance</h3>
        <p>
          If you look carefully, you may have noticed that the algorithm
          spent a lot of its evaulation effort on poorly-performing points
          far from the optimum. If, instead of choosing children randomly
          along one of its parent's dimensions, the algorithm instead chose
          the <em>nearest</em> unevaluated points,
          it might have found the best solution
          much faster. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if faced with a loss function that was more choppy
          that this, such an approach might get stuck in a local minimum
          and fail to find a far better solution. The best approach to use
          depends on which problem we will be solving.
          The No Free Lunch Theorem suggests that no optimizer
          is great at solving all optimization problems.
          The trick with choosing
          an optimizer is place your bets on what type of problems you
          expect to be solving. Will the loss function be smooth?
          Convex? Bounded?
          Low-dimensional? 
          Discrete? Differentiable? Have loosely-coupled dimensions?
          Depending on what you expect to find, you can tweak your optimizer
          to take advantage of those expectations. Just be prepared &mdash;
          if your assumptions are wrong, then your optimizer may fail badly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of Evolutionary Powell's is to be more sample
          efficient than Random, while making weaker assumptions about
          smoothness and continuity than decision tree- or
          Gaussian process-based Bayesian methods.
        </p>
