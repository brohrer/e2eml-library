          Navigating a Data Science Career</a></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          There’s nothing quite as intimate is choosing your next data
          science project, but if it’s not being handed to you by an instructor
          or a program manager, then the world can feel just too wide. How do
          you choose what to work on next? What data to explore?
          What problems to tackle? It can be overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like all questions of importance, I don’t have the answer.
          But if you are feeling well and truly lost, here are some
          tricks that may get you unstuck.
        </p>

        <h3>Find a question to answer</h3>
        <p>
          Applied machine learning and data center science of all varieties
          is an exercise in answering a question using data. No matter
          how much data you have, you can’t exercise your data science skills
          without a question to answer. Choosing a project
          is the act of finding a question to answer. Focus on this.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals drive questions</h3>

        <p>
          Asking a question is the act of getting closer to a goal.
          If my goal is to find a warm loaf of bread, then my question
          becomes "How do I get to the bakery?" Goals drive questions.
          Modeling and analysis is a
          form of locomotion. It moves your understanding forward.
          It propels you from the known into the not yet known.
          But if you don’t have a destiination in mind, you run the
          risk of driving in circles.
        <p>
        </p>
          If you don’t have a burning question already, the fastest way
          to find one is to choose a goal. What do you want?
          This is very personal. Do you want to make a room full of money?
          Stop the spread of COVID19? Build a company with 1000 employees?
          Understand the origin of the universe?
          Find a city to move to?
        </p>
        <p>
          What you want defines who you are.
          Nobody can tell you what that is. If you are able to see deep
          enough into your own self to figure out what that is,
          then you will have a neverending fountain of questions.
          Not all of these will be amenable to analysis, or will have
          appropriate data available, but you will have direction,
          and you will always be able to find an analysis or modeling
          question that gets you a little closer to that goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your goal doesn’t need to be anything profound. It can be to
          tell the story of your local minor-league baseball team
          or to estimate your household carbon footprint.
          And it doesn’t need to be a long term commitment.
          You can change goals with every project. But it’s important
          that you have some purpose in mind.
        </p>

        <h3>Find any question at all</h3>
        <p>
          If finding a grand goal is a tall order for now, then find any
          question at all. It doesn’t matter what it is. The easiest way
          to do this is to steal someone else’s. Re-create their Tidy Tuesday
          data analysis. Implement a paper from scratch. Find a machine
          learning textbook and answer the questions posed at the end
          of each chapter. Stealing questions from others is 100% ethical.
          Not only that, it’s flattering to the original question to asker,
          and as a bonus they provide you with someone else’s answers
          to compare against. It lets you stretch your legs and get
          comfortable with new tools. It is a great way to learn to walk
          before you start to run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind however that all of this is practice. The most
          important thing you will do as a data scientist or machine
          learning practitioner is to choose the right questions to ask.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I choose a good question?</h3>
        <p>
          Just as "Good decisions come from experience,
          and experience comes from bad decisions,"
          also "Useful questions come from experience, and experience
          comes from useless questions."
          There is no field guide, no manual, no cheat sheet for learning
          to ask good questions. It comes through trial and error.
          The best way to climb this learning curve is to take the first step.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish you success in your search for answers. More importantly
          I wish you success in your search for questions.
        </p>
