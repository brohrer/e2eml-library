        <h3>You can stitch images into a movie</h3>

        <code>ffmpeg -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' -y -c:v libx264 movie_name.mp4</code>

        <h3>Or break a movie's frames out into images</h3>
        <code>ffmpeg -i movie_name.mp4 img_%05d.png</code>

          Video is a natural way for us to understand three dimensional and time varying information.
          It's how we navigate the world.
          Converting images to video is a great way to level up your data science results.
          It helps you to communicate more clearly and it gives you eye-catching GIFs in the process.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You can go the other direction too and convert video to a sequence of images.
          This is helpful if you want to do frame-by-frame analysis on video
          in machine learning applications.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html">Install FFmpeg</a>.
            It's a powerful open source audio video processing tool.
            It has a dizzying collection of cryptic command line options, so when you settle on the one
            that meets your needs, it's very much a Wingardium Leviosa moment.
            It's available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure all the images are the same size - that they have the same number of pixel rows and columns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put all the <code>.png</code> images you want to use as video frames into a directory by themselves.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Images are ordered alphabetically by filename and stitched together to make your video.
        <p>
        
        <p>
          For the adventurous, you can exercize absolute control over every step of this process.
          Want to change the frame rate?
          Use a different video filetype? Add music? Just read through
          <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html">the FFmpeg documentation</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>You can help keep open source open</h4>
        <p>
          If this solution works for you, consider
          <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/donations.html">sending support to the FFmpeg project</a>.
          Maybe enough to buy a cup of coffee. Or a coffee machine. It goes toward keeping their servers running.
          All the human work that goes into it is donated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck in your video production!
