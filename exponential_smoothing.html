          Time series data can be noisy and jumpy. To separate the trend
          from the noise its helpful to do a bit of smoothing.
          Straight averaging has the disadvantage of weighting observations
          from the past just as strongly as the most recent ones. If there
          is an underlying trend, this is not ideal, since the trend line
          will have shifted over that period. A good compromise between
          recency and smoothness is
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing">
            exponential smoothing</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exponential smoothing also has the wonderful property of being
          simple to calculate. It is a weighted average of the most
          recent smoothed value, <em>y_(t-1)</em> with
          the new observed value <em>x_t</em>:
          <code>y_t = &alpha; * x_t + (1 - &alpha;) * y_(t-1)</code>,
          where &alpha; is between 0 and 1. For &alpha; close to 1
          recent observations are weighted more heavily, and minimal
          smoothing takes place. For &alpha; close to 0 the new observation
          counts for little, and the subsequent smoothed value will be close
          to the previous one. In that case smoothing is heavy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a rule of thumb, if you want the smoothed signal to reflect
          changes that occur over &tau; time steps, you case use
          <code>&alpha; = 1 / &tau;</code> as a weighting factor.
