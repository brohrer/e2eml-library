        <h3>Patches</h3>

path = [[.1, .4], [.2, .9], [.7, .3]]
ax.add_patch(patches.Polygon(path))</code></pre>

        <p>
          For me, the biggest reason to use Matplotlib is the unlimited
          power it gives you over your plots. To fully unlock this power,
          you need patches. Here's a self-contained example of how to
          make one.
        </p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.patches as patches
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca()
path = [
    [.1, .3],
    [.2, .9],
    [.8, .4],
]
ax.add_patch(patches.Polygon(path))
fig.savefig("patch.png")</code></pre>

        <p>
          Patches are arbitrary two dimensional regions.
          There are a lot of 
          <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/patches_api.html">
            fancy wrappers and helpers</a>,
          like Rectangles, Circles, Boxes, and Ellipses, but if you want
          a single approach that will meet nearly all of your needs, stick
          with
          <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.patches.Polygon.html">
            Polygons</a>. They let you define the outline of any
            two dimensional shape you want, no matter how complex.
        </p>
        <h4>Create the path</h4>
        <p>
          To initialize a Polygon, it needs a set of points defining its
          vertices, an outline path. This will need to be in the form
          of a 2D array with 2 columns, or a similarly shaped list of lists,
          as we used in the exaple above. No need to repeat the start vertex.
          By default, the Polygon closes itself.
        </p>
        <h4>Personalize it</h4>

<pre><code> ax.add_patch(patches.Polygon(
  path,
  alpha=.7,
  edgecolor="darkblue",
  facecolor="red",
  hatch="+",
  joinstyle="miter",
  linestyle="--",
  linewidth=5,
)) </code></pre>
        <img title="a triangle patch with a lot of customization"
          src="https://github.com/brohrer/taming_matplotlib/raw/master/images/fancy_patch.png"
          alt="a triangle patch with a lot of customization"
          style="height: 440px;">

        <p>
          Patches are customizable in all the typical Matplotlib ways.
          Go wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heads up: Unilike lines and points, when you add patches
          to and Axes object, it doesn't automatically change the axis limits
          to include it. You may have to use ax.set_xlim() and ax.set_ylim()
          to expand your Axes so that they show the patch.
          high level functions like plot() and scatter(). 
        </p>

          I've had to google this more times than I can count.
          No more!
