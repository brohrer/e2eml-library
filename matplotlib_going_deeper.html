        <h3>A little bit of big picture goes a long way</h3>
        <p>
          If you remember just these three things, your plotting life will be much
          easier:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#fig_section">Figures hold Axes</a></li>
          <li><a href="#axes_section">Axes hold almost everything else</a></li>
          <li><a href="#agg_section">Backends do the heavy lifting</a></li>

        <h3 id="fig_section">1. <var>Figure</var>s hold <var>Axes</var> objects</h3>
        <p>
          In Matplotlib everything is made of objects.
          There is an object called <var>Figure</var>,
          and one called <var>Axes</var>.
          There are objects called <var>Line2D</var>, <var>Patch</var>,
          <var>Text</var>, <var>Artist</var>, and many others.
          Some objects are children of others, and members of yet others.
          It can get hard to keep track of which objects do what.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most useful relationship to understand is that
          <var>Figure</var> objects contain <var>Axes</var> objects.
          A <var>Figure</var> is just what it sounds like,
          a rectangular blank canvas on which a plot is constructed.
          <var>Axes</var> objects are where all the plotting action happens.
          You can have more than one <var>Axes</var> in a <var>Figure</var>,
          and you can place them wherever you want.
        </p>

<pre><code>fig = pyplot.figure()
ax = fig.gca()</code></pre>

        <p>
           In the first line, we use the <var>pyplot</var> interface
           to initialize a new figure. Then we get the current <var>Axes</var>
           object with <code>gca()</code>. In this case, this is the
           <var>Axes</var> object that is created by default when we
           make our figure.
        </p>


        <h3 id="axes_section">2. <var>Axes</var> hold almost everything else</h3>
        <p>
          Aside from providing locations for <var>Axes</var> objects
          and generating finished plots, a <var>Figure</var> doesn't do much.
          Most of the action takes place
          in an <var>Axes</var> object.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make this explicit in our code, we will make sure
          to work on <var>Axes</var> objects directly rather than
          using the <var>pyplot</var> interface. This helps keep things clear
          when we have more than one <var>Axes</var> object in a
          <var>Figure</var>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, when plotting we’ll use
        </p>

<pre><code>ax.plot(x, y)</pre></code>

        <p>
          Rather than the <code>pyplot.plot(x, y)</code> because
          the latter obscures the relationship between <var>Axes</var>
          and plotting.
        </p>

        <h4>Heads up</h4>
        <p>
          The name "Axes" is a little misleading. An <var>Axes</var>
          object contains both an x-axis and a y-axis (which are
          objects in their own right), as well as lines, patches,
          text annotations, and the region in which these are displayed.
          Throughout these examples, I'll try to be consistent about referring
          to an Axes object as <var>Axes</var> and an x- and y-axis pair as
          axes, lowercase. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="agg_section">3. Backends take care of the complicated parts</h3>

        <p>
          Depending on whether you want to create a file, plot to the screen,
          or in a web browser, depending on what operating system and graphics
          drivers you are
          running, there are lots of of things Matplotlib has to consider when
          creating your plot. This last mile in making the plot concrete is
          handled by part of the Matplotlib code called a backend, and as you
          might imagine, there
          are lots of them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Occasionally not everything plays together
          perfectly and something won't plot or render correctly on some
          combination of backend your particular setup.
          In order to avoid these frustrations, I've found an approach that
          seems pretty robust. Instead of displaying plots to the screen, I
          save them as <var>.png</var> files. Then you can look at them
          using whatever 
          tool you want.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a high-performance backend called AGG (based on
          the Anti-Grain Geometry
          Engine) that works on every system and platform I've tried it
          on. It makes beautiful <var>.png</var> files.
          This approach is great even if you're working on a headless server
          and would like to generate visualizations or reports to look at
          elsewhere.
        </p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib
matplotlib.use("agg")</code></pre>

        <p>
          Invoking these two lines <em>at the very beginning</em> of a python script
          sets up the AGG backend. Due to a quirk of the process, if you try
          to do this after importing <var>pyplot</var>, it will fail to update the
          backend.
        </p>

        <p>
          After setting the backend to "agg",
          you can proceed as usual to import <var>pyplot</var> and
          <var>numpy</var> and
          anything else you might need.
        </p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np</code></pre>

        <p>
          When it comes time to display a plot, you just need to save it to a
          file.
        </p>

<pre><code>fig.savefig("my_new_plot.png")</code></pre>

        <p>
          Passing in the path and name of the new image file to <code>savefig()</code> gets the
          job done.
        </p>

        <h4>Favor clarity over convenience</h4>
        <p>
          To keep things as clean as possible in our code examples,
          we will usually work directly with the <var>Figure</var>
          and <var>Axes</var> objects, rather than using the <var>pyplot</var>
          simplifications that gloss over them. It turns out that
          if we want to do much customization, this makes our job a lot easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          Matplotlib has several ways to do most things,
          and while this can provide convenience,
          it can also create a lot of confusion. 
          We will stick to one way of doing things,
          usually the one that most clearly reflects
          the underlying structure, rather than the one that results
          in the shortest code.
          This also gives us fewer things to remember.
        </p>

        <h4>Method in the madness</h4>
        <p>
          The complexity in Matplotlib is there for good reason.
          Making attractive interactive images on every type of screen
          in every operating system is hard.
          Enabling customization for all our various aesthetics and
          formatting requirements is also hard.
          On top of that, making a simplified interface to this complexity
          that doesn’t scare us all away, but still preserves
          the most useful functionality is harder still.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this in mind, it’s no mean feat that Matplotlib contributors
          have achieved. Started by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hunter">
            John D. Hunter</a>,
          with the lead developer role passing to Michael Droettboom,
          then to Thomas Caswell, working with a small army of developers,
          Matplotlib's contributors have built, maintain, and expand this tool.
          And every single one of them is a volunteer.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're curious, I recommend
          <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/matplotlib.html">
            this article by Hunter and Droettboom 
          </a>. It gives more of Matplotlib's origin story, as well as more of
          the details on how it is architected and why.

          some straighforward examples.
