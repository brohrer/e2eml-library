        <h2>Databases are the new Dataframes</h2>

        <p>
          Not really, but join me in a thought experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine you wanted to do some data analysis, but also
          wanted to avoid importing any external libraries into Python.
          This is not just an academic exercise. A large part of
          the challenge of working in Python is managing dependencies,
          environments, and breaking updates.
          Sticking with base Python and the libraries it ships with
          would make your code considerably more robust and
          lower maintenance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can do exactly this with SQLite3.
          To demonstrate how we would ingest a csv to a Dataframe will
          use the most excellent
          <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/">
            Palmer Penguins Data Set</a><sup>1</sup>.

          Created by Allison Horst,
          Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman, using
          raw data collected by Kristen Gorman, the simplified version
          has eight columns of data on 344 individual penguins.
          For this example, we'll assume that the data
          has already been downloaded from
          <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv">
            this URL</a>
          to a local file named penguins.csv.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the time honored tradition of all cooking websites,
          I put the actual recipe at the end. If that’s what you’re
          looking for, skip to the bottom. In the meantime, there are
          some interesting pieces I want to shine a light on.
        </p>

        <p>
          This example will extend the first database we created in
          <a href="db_first_db.html">this post</a> and take advantage of
          the improved mental model we outlined in
          <a href="db_awkwardness.html">this post</a>. Thanks to the
          foundation we've built, the basic structure will be familiar.
          Again, in keeping with tradition, I will first tell a long
          winded story about each ingredient.
        </p>

        <h2>Schema</h2>

        <p>
          Schema is the official database word for how our table is laid out.
          In its full glory, there are a lot of things a schema can cover,
          like which columns allow NULL values, and which columns are
          likely to be linked to by other tables. But for our purposes,
          we’re just interested in the name of each column and the
          type of data it is expected to contain. This is enough to
          create a table and prepare it to accept our penguin data.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQLite has <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html">
            a few basic data types</a> to choose from.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>INTEGER</strong>, a signed integer like Python's
              <code>int</code>. Conveniently,
              SQLite decides how many bytes to use
              for it based on its size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>REAL</strong>, a floating point number, analogous
              to Python's <code>float</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TEXT</strong>, just like sounds. Analogous to
              Python's <code>str</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>BLOB</strong>, a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">
                Binary Large OBject</a>, this can be literally anything&mdash;
              image, video, executable&mdash;and is a catch-all data type
              that turns SQLite into a multi-tool for the power user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>NULL</strong>, what we would call <code>None</code>
              in Python. You'd never have a column of all NULL values, but you
              may get to a point where you want to be explicit about
              whether a column is allowed to have any NULL values. This
              fun topic we will save for later.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Other
          flavors of SQL have a richer collection of types, but really these are
          enough to do 95% of everything we need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before creating our table, we have to look at our data and
          understand it well enough to know what each column means
          and what type of data we want it to have. This step is worth
          taking your time on. If anyone else ends up using your database
          (including a future of you) naming a column well will save
          them frustration and heartbreak.
        </p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS penguins (
    species TEXT,
    island TEXT,
    bill_length_mm REAL,
    bill_depth_mm REAL,
    flipper_length_mm REAL,
    body_mass_g REAL,
    sex TEXT,
    year INTEGER)</pre></code>

        <p>
          Also, the decision of which data type to use is not always
          straightforward. A classic example of this is money,
          dollars and cents in the US. It has a decimal place,
          so it seems that it should obviously be a REAL value.
          But if you calculate interest and come up with a fractional cent,
          what does that even mean? To avoid confusion should we represent
          money as an INTEGER number of cents? I assume there are some
          detailed accounting rules for how to handle this in
          our modern era, but I want to illustrate that this is a
          potentially deep topic. Any amount of time you spend thinking
          through how your data will be used and how it should be best
          represented to facilitate that use, will be worth it ten times over.
        </p>

        <h2>Data</h2>

        <p>
          The next step is mechanical. Using established Python processes
          we can open the csv and read it in one row at a time.
          The format we need it to be in is a list of rows,
          where each row is a list of the values in each column.
          (Nerd note: Representing each row as a tuple will also work
          and is more consistent with
          the philosophy of the tuple and list data types.)
        </p>

<pre><code>with open("penguins.csv", "rt") as penguin_file:
    reader = csv.reader(penguin_file)
    rows = list(reader)</pre></code>

        <h2>Ingestion</h2>

        <p>
          Ingestion is the fancy database word for grabbing your data 
          from somewhere and sucking it into the database,
          getting it safely tucked away where it can be found and
          retrieved quickly.
          It’s also the technical word for what a toddler does with
          goldfish crackers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The convenient command that ingests our list of lists
          is <code>executemany()</code>. It automatically iterates over
          our list of rows and loads each one into the database.
          We call it with a "?" placeholder for every column. This tells
          the VALUES command how many column values to look for in the data.
        </p>

<pre><code>cursor.executemany("""
    INSERT INTO penguins VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
""", rows)</pre></code>

        <p>
          Using the question mark is an important part of this.
          It’s possible to do clever Python string substitution,
          and explicitly write the values to be ingested into the SQL query.
          But this is a bad, bad thing. If you are using data
          that someone else generated, and that someone wanted to be
          a real jerk, they could hand craft data that looks like
          SQL commands. If your Python script substitutes that
          data in verbatim, then your database will do whatever
          your adversary wants. They could change values, add rows,
          delete rows, or even delete the whole database.
          This is called a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">
            SQL injection attack</a>,
          and it’s definitely
          not something you want to experience firsthand.

        <p>
          Fortunately, using the "?" placeholder allows SQLite to use its
          built-in checks to prevent this. The question marks are your
          security guards.
        </p>

          <h2>Committing</h2>

        <p>
          The final piece is a <code>commit()</code> statement.
          So far everything we’ve done to the database is just a rough draft.
          If we close the database and open it up again, it will be as
          if we never ingested anything. To make it permanent
          we need to add a final stamp of approval,
          and if you have commitment issues, now is the time to face them.
        </p>
<pre><code>connection.commit()</code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
          That wraps up the bits that we haven’t covered in previous posts.
          The rest hopefully looks familiar.
          Here’s the whole concoction when it’s been mixed together
          and baked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.
        </p>

        <pre><code>import csv
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("penguins.db")
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS penguins (
    species TEXT,
    island TEXT,
    bill_length_mm REAL,
    bill_depth_mm REAL,
    flipper_length_mm REAL,
    body_mass_g REAL,
    sex TEXT,
    year INTEGER)
""")

with open("penguins.csv", "rt") as penguin_file:
    reader = csv.reader(penguin_file)
    rows = list(reader)
    cursor.executemany("INSERT INTO penguins VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)", rows)
connection.commit()

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM penguins")
print(cursor.fetchall())
connection.close()</code></pre>
