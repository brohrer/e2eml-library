          Occasionally the need arises to convert a color image to grayscale.
          This need came up when loading images taken on the surface
          of Mars as part of
          <a href="https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/advanced-neural-network-methods">
          End-to-End Machine Learning Course 313, Advanced Neural Network
          Methods</a>. We were working with a mixture of color and
          grayscale images and needed to transform them into a uniform
          format - all grayscale.
          We're going to be working in Python using the Numpy and Matplotlib
          packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/brohrer/cottonwood_martian_images/blob/master/image_loader.py">
            code we're working from</a> loads jpeg images for an autoencoder
            to use as inputs. This is accomplished with Matplotlib's
            image reader:
        </p>
        <p>
          <tt>img = matplotlib.pyplot.imread(
              os.path.join(path, imagename), format='jpeg')</tt>
        </p>
        <p>
          Matplotlib reads the image in and converts it into a Numpy array.
          For grayscale images, this is a two-dimensional array with the
          number of rows and columns equal to the number of pixel rows
          and columns in the image. Usually low numeric values indicate
          darker shades and higher values lighter shades. The range
          of pixel values can be 0 to 1 or 0 to 255 or something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Color images are represented as three-dimensional Numpy arrays -
          a collection of three two-dimensional arrays, one each for red,
          green, and blue channels. Each one, like grayscale arrays,
          has one value per pixel and their ranges are identical.
        </p>
        <p>
          An intuitive way to convert a color image 3D array to a grayscale
          2D array is, for each pixel, take the average of the red, green,
          and blue pixel values to get the grayscale value. The code
          in the repository does this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <tt>img = numpy.mean(img, axis=2)</tt>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt>axis=2</tt> argument tells <tt>numpy.mean()</tt> to
          average values across all three color channels.
          (<tt>axis=0</tt> would average across pixel rows and
          <tt>axis=1</tt> would average across pixel columns.)
        </p>
