          This is the talk I gave at the Open Data Science Conference in Boston, May 2017. A lot you have asked me for the slides. Here they are, with a recording of a dry run through the presentation.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Deep learning is the technology driving today's artificial intelligence boom. It is particularly good at image classification, for instance, deciding whether a picture contains a cat. To get the best results, it's helpful to understand how they work. We will take a gentle, detailed tour though a multilayer fully-connected neural network, backpropagation and a convolutional neural network. You won't need any background in math, programming or machine learning.

        <p>
          At Facebook we use deep neural networks as part of our effort to connect the entire world. To provide network connectivity to everyone, we first have to know where everyone is. We use deep learning to find buildings in satellite images so that we know which network technologies will work best and where to deploy them.
