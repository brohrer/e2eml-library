          Like religion, kids, and how to hang the toilet paper, data types
          are a conversation you can only put off for so long.
          If you are relatively new to Python, this will give you
          a good enough understanding to get started with.
          It won’t be exhaustive, but it will keep you from shooting
          yourself in the foot.

        <h2>The big four</h2>
        <p>
          Most of our variables in Python are either
          <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>integers</strong> (<code>int</code>),<br>
            whole numbers like 2, 300, 6 million, 0, or -7
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>floating point numbers</strong> (<code>float</code>),<br>
            numbers with a decimal place, like
            6.4, -.9, .0001, or 500.005
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>strings of characters</strong> (<code>str</code>),<br>
            like "Bob", "abracadabra",
            "xvCd5Kp6q", "%#*$", "z", and can even include emojis
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Booleans</strong> (<code>bool</code>),<br>
            either True or False
          </li>
          </ul>
          or some amalgam of these.
        </p>

        <h2>Find out a variable's type</h2>
        <p>
          There's a convenient built-in function <code>type()</code>
          that can tell you the type of a variable.
        </p>

<pre><code>>>> a = 8
>>> print(type(a))
&lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          This is also great for checking whether a variable is of a
          particular type.
        </p>

<pre><code>>>> print(type(a) == int)
True</code></pre>

        <h2>Cast a variable from one type to another</h2>
        <p>
          Python also has the power to transform variables from one type
          to another, whenever there's a reasonable way to do it. The
          casting functions are named after the types:
          <code>int()</code>,
          <code>float()</code>,
          <code>str()</code>, and
          <code>bool()</code>.
        </p>

<pre><code># Start with a str
>>> b = "5.0"
>>> print(b)
5.0
>>> print(type(b))
&lt;class 'str'&gt;

# Cast a str to a float
>>> c = float(b)
>>> print(c)
5.0
>>> print(type(c))
&lt;class 'float'&gt;

# Cast a float to an int
>>> d = int(c)
>>> print(d)
5
>>> print(type(d))
&lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>

        <h2>Four secrets to keeping track of your variables' types</h2>
        <h3>1. Different types can mean the same thing</h3>
        <p>
          Mathematically, we know that the integer 1
          and the floating point number 1.0 mean the same thing.
          Inside a computer this is no longer true. Different types are
          as different as foreign languages. The words "one" and
          "один" represent the same underlying concept but are otherwise
          entirely different. Likewise, an integer <code>1</code>
          and a floating point <code>1.0</code> have entirely different
          representations on the computer,
          different patterns and even different numbers of bits.
          A bit by bit comparison would show they are not even close.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Different types can look the same</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes different types can look identical when you put them
          in a print statement. The number three is an abstract thing,
          but it can be represented by a character, the numeral "3".
          To show a number, a
          computer first has to translate it into a sequence of
          characters. Minus seventeen becomes "-17".
          One and a half becomes "1.5". After this translation happens,
          you can't tell whether the "1.5" you see on the screen was
          originally the floating point representation of one
          and a half or the character string "1", ".", and "5". They
          end up looking identical on the screen. This makes it
          easy to forget that they might actually have originated as different
          types and might mean something different.
        </p>

<pre><code>>>> a = "1.5"
>>> print(type(a))
&lt;class 'str'&gt;

>>> b = 1.5
>>> print(type(b))
&lt;class 'float'&gt;

>>> print(a, b)
1.5 1.5</code></pre>

        <h3>3. Python doesn't check types</h3>
        <p>
          Consider this <code>add()</code> function.
        </p>
<pre><code>def add(a, b):
    return a + b</code></pre>
        <p>
          Nowhere does it specify whether <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> 
          should be integers, floats, or strings. A lot of other languages
          require this, but Python doesn't. All it cares is that whatever
          you pass in has a plus operator defined for it. The nerd word
          for this is <em>duck typing</em>, as in "if it walks like a
          duck and talks lke a duck (and in our case, adds like a duck),
          then we'll call it a duck". As long as the variables can do whatever
          is asked of them, Python doesn't care what they are. Never mind
          that the plus operator adds integers and concatenates strings.
          As long is the code can be carried out on the arguments, then
          that's good enough for Python.
        </p>
<pre><code>>>> add(4, 7)
11

>>> add ("some", "strings")
'somestrings'</code></pre>

        <p>
          This flexibility can take some of the pressure off to have
          your functions know exactly what types they need to handle, and
          it can allow your functions to handle several types seamlessly,
          but it can also cause trouble. If you are thinking that
          <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are integers when they are actually
          strings, the <code>add()</code> function will be happy to let you
          go on believing that, rather than throw a helpful error.
        </p>


        <h3>4. Python can automatically change variables' types</h3>
        <p>
          In an effort to be helpful, Python also does some automatic type
          conversion without you even asking, called <em>implicit casting</em>.
          It's really helpful if you're trying to add 7, an integer, to 3.3,
          a float. Integers and floating point numbers are apples and oranges.
          They can't be meaningfully added. Fortunately, Python has some
          built-in logic that interprets this as a request to add the
          floating point number 7 to 3.3, and gives that intuitive result 10.3.
        </p>

<pre><code>>>> m = 7
>>> print(type(m))
&lt;class 'int'&gt;

>>> n = 3.3
>>> print(type(n))
&lt;class 'float'&gt;

>>> p = m + n
>>> print(p)
10.3
>>> print(type(p))
&lt;class 'float'&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          This all happens without any pedantic error messages and is
          part of Python's appeal as a first programming language.
          It also makes it easy to forget that ints and floats are very
          different things, and that not all operations are so convenient
          to interpret. After performing a few lines of computation with
          our variables, it's tough to keep track of which have been
          up-cast from integer to float. It's not a fatal flaw, but it
          can bite you in the butt occassionally.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
          Python does everything in its power to let you ignore types.
          But once you have
          a clear mental picture of your variables types and how
          Python is interpreting them, you'll be able to avoid some
          extremely painful debugging and walk more confidently through your
          coding projects.
