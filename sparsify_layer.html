        <h3>Sparsifying layer for neural networks</h3>
        <p>
          This layer type enforces L0 sparsity in node activities
          by setting all but N node activities to zero.
        </p>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>
          The mechanism for doing this is a Sparsification layer,
          implemented in the
          <a href="https://e2eml.school/cottonwood">
            Cottonwood machine learning framework</a>
          as an experimental class.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sparsification layer is initialized with a set number
          of active notes, <em>N</em>. On each forward pass, the <em>N</em>
          nodes with
          the highest activity are left unchanged, and all other node
          activities are set to zero. Then forward propagation
          continues with the next layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the backpropagation pass, gradients for all the nodes
          that had been set to zero are also set to zero before passing
          them back to the previous layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a couple of things to keep in mind when using
          a sparsification layer in a neural network &mdash how to
          initialize the weights of the next layer and how to
          modify the gradient during backpropagation.
        </p>

        <h4>Initialization</h4>
        <p>
          Some weight initialization
          methods use the number of inputs to the layer or "fan in" to
          choose appropriate values. If the full number of inputs is
          <em>M</em>,
          a sparsification layer effectively
          reduces the number of inputs to <em>N</em>,
          the number of non-zero inputs.
          Initialization methods work best when they account for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          In He and Glorot initializers, this means adjusting the parameters
          of the distribution from which the weights are drawn to use
          <em>N</em>
          instead of <em>M</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly in the LSUV initializer, this means scaling
          the distribution by <em>sqrt(M/N)</em>.
          This ensures that with the reduced number of non-zero inputs,
          the variance of the output nodes will still be near 1.
        </p>

        <h4>Sensitivity</h4>
        <p>
          Because the nodes with the highest activity are selected on each
          pass, it's possible that some nodes will only be selected very
          rarely. These nodes are an untapped resource. They have the
          potential to represent structure in the data that would otherwise
          contribute to the error. However, because they are selected so
          rarely it takes them a long time to train. This is particularly
          the case for rarely occurring patterns in the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to speed up this process of learning rare patterns,
          nodes that haven't been selected in a while develop a sensitivity,
          meaning that when they are finally selected, they adapt more
          readily during backpropagation. In this way, they can migrate
          to where they can do the most good,
          even though the patterns they represent might be uncommon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sensitivity, <em>s</em>, is a multiplicative factor on the
          gradient on a node-by-node basis. It starts at 1, and gradually
          increases toward an upper limit, <em>s_max</em>, with each time step
          the node is not selected. The adaptation occurs with a time
          constant of <em>tau</em>. At each time step, the new sensitivity for
          unselected nodes, <em>s_new</em>, is a function of their
          previous sensitivity, <em>s_old</em>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp s_new = s_old + (s_max - s_old) / tau</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Empirically, <em>s_max = 10</em> and <em>tau = 100</em>
          have proven to work well,
          but it's possible that other values may work even better.
        </p>

        <h3>Example implementation</h3>
        <p>
          We can see qualitatively how the sparse layer changes the features
          that a network learns by looking at an autoencoder. In
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/brohrer/study-mars-images">
            a case study using an autoencoder to compress images from Mars</a>,
          there is a ready-made testbed. The file
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/brohrer/study-mars-images/-/blob/master/sparse_compressor.py">
            sparse_compressor.py</a> has the code used for this demonstration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The autoencoder used takes an 11 x 11 pixel patch (121 pixels), and
          passes it through 2-layers, a 256-node hidden layer and a 121-node
          output layer. The representation of each hidden node was found
          by setting its activity to 1, and the activity of all other hidden
          nodes to 0, and observing the output pixel activity that resulted.
          For more details on the architecture and its implementation,
          please refer to the README in the case study code.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The autoencoder was trained on 10 million image patches under two
          different conditions. In the dense condition,
          all 256 of the hidden nodes were
          updated on every iteration. This is standard procedure.
          In the sparse condition, only the 9 nodes with the highest magnitude
          activities were allowed to stay active. The rest were set to zero.

          The output representation of a few nodes from the hidden dense layer.
          The nodes are information-dense, but visually indistinct.
          They look like static.

        </p>
        <p>
          The output representation of a few nodes from the hidden sparse layer.
          Many of the hidden nodes took on clear spatial patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The differences between the two sets of hidden node representations
          is striking. In the sparse layer, the patterns became identifiable
          and varied in spatial frequency, complexity, and orientation.

        <h3>With convolutional layers</h3>
        <p>
          When you're working with a convolutional neural network, there's
          an alternative way to apply sparsity. Instead of choosing just
          <em>N</em> non-zero values from the entire layer's output,
          you can choose the output of <em>N</em> channels at each position
          in the image or signal. This method is implemented in
          Cottonwood's
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/brohrer/cottonwood/-/blob/main/cottonwood/experimental/sparsify.py">
            SparsifyByChannel2D block</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Neural networks are very flexible, because they have so many
          parameters that can be adjusted. Sometimes it feels like too many.
          It’s like having a wall full of knobs for adjusting the sound
          in the recording studio, only some of the knobs do the same
          things as others . Sometimes, it’s nice to simplify it a
          little bit — to reduce the number of knobs you have to adjust.
        </p>
        <p>
          In neural networks this is achieved through regular position.
          Regularization is the mathy way of nudging the solution in
          a particular direction, in this case in the direction of having
          fewer knobs to adjust. If we can take a fraction of those
          parameters and set them to zero, then we can put Scotch tape
          over those knobs and pretend they don’t exist. This flavor of
          regularization is a trick to set as many of those knobs to zero
          (or at least a small value) as we can without hurting performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is regularization for sparsity, sparsity being the state
          where lots of values are set to zero, and the nonzero values
          then become rare, sparse. The most common types of regularization
          operate on the weights in a neural network. They aim to make
          weight values small or zero. They are called L1 regularization,
          also known as ridge regression, and L2 regularization,
          also known as LASSO or least squares regression.
          L1 and L2 refer to the proper mathematical names of the function
          norm that is used in each of these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although having sparsity in the weights is desirable,
          having sparsity in the node activities is even better.
          It is more theoretically interesting, because it suggests that
          only part of the network is working at any given time,
          and it’s of practical interest, because it can be used to reduce
          the computations that have to be made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sparsity in node activities is a type of group sparsity.
          It’s not a quantity that we get to adjust directly during
          backpropagation, but one that emerges through a combination
          of many weights and previous layers' activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          L1 and L2 node activity sparsity regular station has been
          presented previously. Here, I propose a method for
          L0 node sparsity, that is, keeping the number of active nodes
          low.
